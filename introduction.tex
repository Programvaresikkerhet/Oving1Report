\section{Introduction}

{\bf The Exercise:} In this exercise our task was to plan and conduct penetration testing 
of the highly insecure online website “Amu-Darya Bookstore”. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {\bf Part 1:} We do not currently have any access to the source code, so the 
		testing is based on the so-called “black box” testing principles.
		\item {\bf Part 2:} We have access to the source code, so the testing is based on 
		the so-called “white box” testing principles.
	\end{itemize}


The website is made for studying purpose and we have the approval of the owner to do 
penetration testing. In the approval there are some rules to follow:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Hack nondestructively! if you bring the entire application down, you won’t get any work done until we redeploy it.
	\item You are not allowed to exploit the server OS, meaning that you should not run attacks that affects other groups than the one you are attacking.
	\item DoS (Denial of Service) attacks are not allowed.
\end{itemize}

{\bf The website: } The Amu-Darya website is a simple website to order books. 
As a user you can register as a user, log in and order books. The bookstore has 
support a site for complaing and information about the books you can buy.
As a user you have a profile and can add/edit information about name, email, 
address and paymentinformation.

{\bf The method:} the exercise is divided into two parts. We will use two testing 
approahes calles black box and white box testing. The black box testing is done without any access to the source code and the white box testing is done with access to the source code.

{\bf The goal:} The goal of this exercise is to become more familiar with both the planning and practical part of security testing whith to different approaches (black box and white box testing). 

{\bf The group’s experience with security testing:} Neither of the members of the group has ever done anything like planning for security testing or conducting a penetration test. Both the black box and the white box testing was a new experience, so we did spent much of our time for pre-studying to get startet with this exercise.
